Description: The ultrapolaRplot library for R is designed for plotting traced ultrasound tongue
    imaging data according to a polar coordinate system. 
    There is currently support for plotting means and standard deviations of each category's trace; 
    SSANOVA could be implemented as well.  The origin of the polar coordinates may be defined 
    manually or automatically determined based on different algorithms.
    Currently ultrapolaRplot supports ultrasound tongue imaging trace data from [UltraTrace 
    (<https:// github.com/SwatPhonLab/UltraTrace>).  UltraTrace is capable of importing data from 
    Articulate Instruments AAA.
    read_textgrid.R is required for opening TextGrids to determine category and alignment information 
    of ultrasound traces.
